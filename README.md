# Heapify

A very fast JavaScript priority queue, implemented using a binary heap, which in turn is implemented using two underlying parallel [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray).

Supported operations:

- push: O(log n)
- pop: O(log n)
- peek: O(1)
